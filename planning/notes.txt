Base (the “static core”)

Grub

Kernel: build a monolithic, hardware-tailored kernel so a machine can boot without initrd (tool-assisted: detect HW → generate .config → build).

Init: a static init layer (TBD): either patched Emacs acting as init, or a tiny shim that does the early mounts/setup then exec’s Emacs.

PID1/control plane: static Emacs supervisor (your supervisor.el) runs the system: targets, deps, restarts, timers, logging, dashboard, CLI, sandboxing.

Userland essentials: GNU coreutils (serious GNU base) + static git.

Filesystem model: rootfs is a git repo — / is checked in, so the base state is versioned and reproducible.

The missing product

A single base management tool that:

scans hardware and generates kernel configs for “no-initrd” boots

builds the static base artifacts (kernel/init/emacs/coreutils/git)

assembles the rootfs image and enforces invariants

handles updates/rollback for the base (so it’s safe to run)

Everything else

    Use Guix for non-base software and the broader ecosystem:

        Xorg/Wayland, desktop stack, apps, dev tools, etc.



    Runtime OS (stalimacs): static, minimal, stable, no compilers required.

    Build OS (Guix environment): reproducible toolchain + reproducible build scripts that emit your base artifacts.
