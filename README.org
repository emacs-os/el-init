* supervisor.el

`supervisor.el` is an Emacs user-session process supervisor.

It manages background programs from inside Emacs with:

- validated config parsing
- staged startup (`stage1 -> stage2 -> stage3 -> stage4`)
- intra-stage dependency ordering (`:after`)
- restart/crash-loop handling for long-running processes
- oneshot orchestration with wait/timeout semantics
- a tabulated dashboard for control and inspection
- structured events and legacy compatibility hooks

This is user-session supervision, not a system init replacement.

** Requirements

- Emacs 27.1+
- `supervisor.el` available in `load-path`

** Install And Enable

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'supervisor)

(setq supervisor-programs
      '(("xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr" :type oneshot :stage stage1 :id "cursor")
        ("/usr/lib/polkit-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1"
         :type simple :stage stage2 :id "polkit" :restart t)
        ("nm-applet" :type simple :stage stage3 :id "nm" :restart t)
        ("pasystray" :type simple :stage stage4 :id "tray" :restart t)))

(supervisor-mode 1)
#+end_src

When Emacs is your session owner (for example EXWM), typical hooks are:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'elpaca-after-init-hook #'supervisor-start)
(add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook #'supervisor-stop-now)
#+end_src

`supervisor-stop-now` is synchronous and intended for `kill-emacs-hook`.

** Public Commands

| Command | What it does |
| `M-x supervisor-mode` | Global mode. Enable -> `supervisor-start`; disable -> `supervisor-stop`; also starts/stops config watch |
| `M-x supervisor-start` | Build plan, validate, and start entries by stage |
| `M-x supervisor-stop` | Asynchronous graceful shutdown (`SIGTERM`, then timeout `SIGKILL`) |
| `M-x supervisor-stop-now` | Synchronous hard shutdown (`SIGKILL` + brief wait) |
| `M-x supervisor-reload` | Reconcile runtime state against current config |
| `M-x supervisor` | Open dashboard buffer `*supervisor*` |
| `M-x supervisor-validate` | Validate config and show errors without starting |
| `M-x supervisor-dry-run` | Show computed startup order and metadata without starting |

** Configuration Model

Set `supervisor-programs` to a list of entries.

Entry forms:

- String command: `"nm-applet"`
- List command + plist: `("nm-applet" :id "nm" :stage stage3 ...)`

*** Entry Keywords

| Keyword | Type | Default | Notes |
| `:id` | string | executable basename | Must be string when provided |
| `:type` | symbol | `simple` | `simple` or `oneshot` |
| `:stage` | symbol | `stage3` | `stage1`, `stage2`, `stage3`, `stage4` |
| `:delay` | number | `0` | Non-negative seconds |
| `:after` | string or list of strings | `nil` | Dependencies in same stage |
| `:enabled` | boolean | `t` | Enable entry |
| `:disabled` | boolean | `nil` | Inverse form of `:enabled` |
| `:restart` | boolean | `t` for `simple` | Invalid for `oneshot` |
| `:no-restart` | boolean | `nil` | Inverse form of `:restart` |
| `:logging` | boolean | `t` | Per-process stdout/stderr logging |
| `:oneshot-wait` | boolean | `supervisor-oneshot-default-wait` | Invalid for `simple` |
| `:async` | boolean | `nil` | Alias for non-blocking oneshot |
| `:oneshot-timeout` | number or `nil` | `supervisor-oneshot-timeout` | Invalid for `simple` |
| `:tags` | symbol/string/list | `nil` | Dashboard tag filtering labels |

*** Validation Rules

Entries are validated before startup and in validate/dry-run.

- unknown keywords are rejected
- `:id` must be a string
- `:type` must be symbol and one of `simple`/`oneshot`
- `:stage` must be symbol and one of `stage1..stage4`
- `:delay` must be non-negative number
- `:oneshot-timeout` must be number or `nil`
- mutually exclusive pairs are rejected:
- `:enabled` with `:disabled`
- `:restart` with `:no-restart`
- `:oneshot-wait` with `:async`
- type-specific restrictions are enforced:
- `oneshot` rejects `:restart` and `:no-restart`
- `simple` rejects `:oneshot-wait`, `:async`, `:oneshot-timeout`

Invalid entries are skipped by startup/reload and shown as `invalid` in dashboard with reason.

Duplicate IDs: first valid occurrence wins; later duplicates are skipped.

*** Internal Normalized Shape

Every valid entry is normalized internally to:

#+begin_src elisp
(id cmd delay enabled-p restart-p logging-p type stage after
    oneshot-wait oneshot-timeout tags)
#+end_src

** Startup Execution Model

`supervisor-start` runs an asynchronous staged DAG scheduler.

*** Plan Build (Before Scheduling)

1. Parse/validate all entries.
2. Deduplicate IDs.
3. Partition by stage.
4. Validate `:after` dependencies against same-stage IDs.
5. Ignore missing/cross-stage deps with warning.
6. Topologically sort each stage with stable input-order tie-break.
7. If cycle detected, clear all `:after` edges in that stage and use list order.

*** Stage Scheduling

- Stages run sequentially: `stage1`, `stage2`, `stage3`, `stage4`.
- Entries inside a stage may start in parallel (dependency constrained).
- Optional `supervisor-max-concurrent-starts` limits concurrent spawn attempts.

*** Ready Semantics

Readiness (used to unblock dependents and complete stages):

- `simple`: ready when spawned successfully
- `oneshot`: ready when exited (success/failure) or timed out
- disabled: treated as ready immediately
- failed spawn: treated as ready immediately

*** Stage Completion Criteria

A stage is complete only when all are true:

- all stage entries reached started/skipped/failed-to-spawn accounting
- no pending delay timers
- no pending blocking oneshots

*** Timeouts

- Per-entry oneshot timeout via `:oneshot-timeout` (or `supervisor-oneshot-timeout` default)
- Optional `supervisor-stage-timeout` can force stage completion and mark unstarted entries as `stage-timeout`

** Entry Lifecycle State Machine

`supervisor--entry-state` tracks normalized lifecycle state.

States:

- `stage-not-started`
- `waiting-on-deps`
- `delayed`
- `disabled`
- `started`
- `failed-to-spawn`
- `stage-timeout`

Transitions are validated by a central helper. Invalid transitions error unless forced.

** Process Lifecycle And Restart

*** Spawn Model

Processes start via `make-process` with argv from `split-string-and-unquote`.
No implicit shell interpretation is performed.

If shell behavior is needed (pipes, redirects, expansion), call a shell explicitly,
for example `"sh -c '..."`.

*** Restart Model (`simple` only)

- restart allowed only when effective restart policy is enabled
- restart delay uses `supervisor-restart-delay`
- crash loop window uses `supervisor-restart-window`
- when crash count reaches `supervisor-max-restarts`, entry is marked failed (`dead`) and restart stops

`oneshot` entries do not restart.

*** Runtime Overrides

Dashboard toggles set runtime overrides for next starts/restarts:

- enabled override (`e`)
- restart override (`r`)
- logging override (`l`)

** Reload Reconciler

`supervisor-reload` uses a declarative reconcile pipeline:

1. build plan
2. build runtime snapshot
3. compute actions (`start`, `stop`, `noop`, `skip`)
4. apply actions

Behavior:

- stop running entries removed from config
- stop running entries now effectively disabled
- start eligible entries present in config but not running
- skip failed entries and completed oneshots
- keep already converged entries as `noop`

It does not auto-restart already-running entries because command/plist changed.

** Stop Semantics

*** `supervisor-stop` (asynchronous)

- enters shutdown mode
- cancels delayed/restart timers and DAG state
- emits cleanup event
- sends `SIGTERM` to live supervised processes
- completes by sentinel accounting
- after `supervisor-shutdown-timeout`, sends `SIGKILL` to survivors

*** `supervisor-stop-now` (synchronous)

- enters shutdown mode
- cancels delayed/restart timers and DAG state
- emits cleanup event
- sends immediate `SIGKILL`
- waits briefly (up to ~0.5s) for process death
- clears process table and sets completion flag

** Dashboard (`M-x supervisor`)

Dashboard is `tabulated-list-mode` in buffer `*supervisor*`.

Rows and header are built from a shared runtime snapshot per refresh.

*** Columns

- `ID`
- `Type`
- `Stage`
- `Enabled`
- `Status`
- `Restart`
- `Log`
- `PID`
- `Reason`

*** Status Values

- `running`
- `done`
- `failed`
- `dead`
- `pending`
- `stopped`
- `invalid`

*** Reason Values

- `disabled`
- `delayed`
- `waiting-on-deps`
- `stage-not-started`
- `failed-to-spawn`
- `stage-timeout`
- `crash-loop`

*** Dashboard Keys

| Key | Action |
| `e` | Toggle enabled override |
| `f` | Cycle stage filter |
| `t` | Cycle tag filter |
| `s` | Start entry |
| `k` | Kill entry (confirm) |
| `K` | Kill entry (no confirm) |
| `r` | Toggle restart override |
| `l` | Toggle logging override |
| `L` | View entry log file |
| `p` | Open `proced` |
| `P` | Toggle proced auto-update |
| `d` | Show dependency info for entry |
| `D` | Show full dependency graph |
| `B` | Show startup blame timings |
| `g` | Refresh dashboard |
| `G` | Toggle dashboard auto-refresh |
| `?` | Show entry details (`C-u ?` shows status legend) |
| `h` | Open full dashboard help |
| `q` | Quit dashboard |

Notes:

- separator rows reject process actions with user error
- dependency graph and blame need startup metadata from `supervisor-start`
- invalid entries are shown when stage filter is not active

** Logging

Two logging layers exist:

- Supervisor-level log (`supervisor.log`) controlled by `supervisor-log-to-file`
- Per-process logs `log-<id>.log` controlled by entry/effective logging

On session start, existing per-process `log-*.log` files are rotated to timestamped names.

** Config File Watch

`supervisor-watch-config` options:

- `nil`: disabled
- `t`: watch `user-init-file`
- string path: watch that file

On file change, reload is debounced by 1 second, then `supervisor-reload` runs.
`supervisor-mode` starts/stops watching automatically.

** Structured Events And Hooks

*** Unified Event Hook

`supervisor-event-hook` receives one plist argument:

- `:type` event type symbol
- `:ts` float timestamp
- `:id` process ID or `nil`
- `:stage` stage symbol or `nil`
- `:data` event-specific payload plist

Event types:

- `stage-start`
- `stage-complete`
- `process-started`
- `process-ready`
- `process-exit`
- `process-failed`
- `cleanup`

`process-ready` semantics:

- simple process spawned and ready
- oneshot exited (success/failure) or timed out
- not emitted for disabled entries
- not emitted for failed spawn attempts

*** Legacy Hooks (Compatibility)

Legacy hooks are still supported and dispatched by the event adapter:

- `supervisor-cleanup-hook`
- `supervisor-stage-start-hook`
- `supervisor-stage-complete-hook`
- `supervisor-process-exit-hook` (`id status code`)

`supervisor-process-exit-hook` status values:

- `exited`
- `signal`
- `unknown`
